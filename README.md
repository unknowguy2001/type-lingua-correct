## About the app
Type Lingua Correct will changes your language between Thai and English while you're having fun typing. However, if you forget to switch languages before typing, we'll solve that problem for you!

## Technologies
I used Next Js for frontend and express for backend

## Setup
First, you need to go to the client directory by opening the project, and then open the terminal (inside VSCode). Type 'cd client' and then 'npm i'. Do the same in the server directory. Then you can use 'npm run dev' in the server directory and client directory. When you're finished, go to 'http://localhost:3000' in your browser and enjoy using it. Thanks!
